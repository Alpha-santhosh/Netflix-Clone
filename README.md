# [Netflix-Clone](https://netflix-clone-brown-one.vercel.app/)

## Project Overview -
- The objective of the project is to develop a web application that simulates the Netflix streaming platform. The application should provide users with a similar user experience to the original Netflix app, with the ability to browse movies, TV shows, and other content, and create watchlists.

## Goals - 
- To create a web application that simulates the Netflix streaming platform.
- To create an application that is visually appealing, user-friendly, and accessible to a wide range of users.
- To integrate third-party APIs for streaming video, user authentication, and other features to improve the user experience.
- To provide users with a similar user experience to the original Netflix app, with the ability to browse movies, TV shows, and other content, and create watchlists.

## Objectives - 
- To implement the frontend using technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.
- To design the application architecture, and APIs that will be used to interact with the frontend.
- To define the project scope and requirements and document them in a project plan.

## Technologies -
- ReactJS : ReactJS is a popular front-end library that allows you to build reusable components to create a dynamic user interface. It provides state management   capabilities, which can make it easier to manage the data and state of your application.
- Tmdb API : The Tmdb API is a RESTful API that allows you to retrieve movie data, such as titles, posters, release dates, and ratings. You can use this data to create different components for displaying movies, such as a banner component to showcase trending movies or a row component to display movies based on genres.
- HTML : HTML is a markup language that is used to create the structure and content of your web pages. It provides a range of elements and tags that can be used to create headings, paragraphs, lists, and other types of content.
- CSS : CSS is a stylesheet language that is used to add style and formatting to your web pages. It provides a range of properties and values that can be used to adjust the size, color, font, and layout of your content.
- Git : Git is a version control system that allows you to manage and track changes to your codebase. It helps you to collaborate with others and keep track of your project history.
- GitHub : GitHub is a web-based platform that allows you to host and manage your Git repositories. It provides a range of features, such as collaboration tools, issue tracking, and pull requests, to help you work on your project with others.
- Vercel: Vercel is a cloud platform that specializes in hosting and deploying serverless web applications. It provides a range of features and tools to help you build, deploy, and manage your web applications.
